README file for Digital Image Processing Project FALLBACK edition
Language: Python / Java
People: Andrew Hauser / Josh Rodkey / Christian Wirth

Installation Notes:
1. Must have ImageMagick installed
	You can do this on a debian based linux system with "sudo apt-get install imagemagick".
2. Must have PIL (Python Imaging Library) installed. 
	It is installed by default on Ubuntu.
	You can get it for Windows from http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/

I can't ensure this will run on Windows as it is. It runs on Ubuntu Linux with ImageMagick and PIL just fine. Screenshots should be included in the git repo.
So far, the program will display a histogram for each image in the folder.

Things that haven't been implemented yet:

1. A baseline
2. Printing of information about the attributes of the images.
3. A GUI


WE'RE OFF TO A GOOD START
